This addon takes the amount of haste, crit, etc. rating on an item, turn it into a percentage, and then adds it next to the rating in your tooltip.

Shadowlands Updates: 

Version 2.0.0 is released with hopefully full support for the squish and new Diminishing returns on secondary stats. 

On Weapons, rings and trinkets, you will now see two sets of the output. This is not a bug but a new feature. This is to hopefully report correct outputs if you were to replace the item in either slot it is able to be equipped into, if doing so causes you to be in a different DR tier for each slot.
